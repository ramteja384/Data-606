# Analyzing-Individual-Preparedness-for-Effective-Disaster-Response-Strategies
This repository explores Cybersecurity threats pose significant risks to organizations and individuals worldwide. With cyberattacks becoming increasingly complex and sophisticated, there is an urgent need to develop robust methods for detection and mitigation. To meet these challenges, a network intrusion detection technique is proposed, utilizing the collective power of multiple machine learning algorithms.

## Project Goals
1. Identify the key features and patterns indicative of malicious activities in network traffic data.
2. Develop machine learning models to predict cyber-attacks based on various networking features.
3. This research is expected to contribute to the advancement of cybersecurity by providing insights into cyber attack behaviors and the development of effective threat detection models.

## Research Questions
1. How can machine learning algorithms be applied to analyze the UNSW-NB15 dataset and detect different types of cyber-attacks.
2. What are the key features and patterns indicative of malicious activities in network traffic data.
3. How do different machine learning models perform in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for cybersecurity threat detection?

## Methodology

### 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:

1. The UNSW-NB 15 dataset's raw network packets were generated in the Cyber Range Lab of UNSW Canberra using the IXIA PerfectStorm tool. This process aimed to produce a blend of genuine, contemporary normal activities and artificially generated attack behaviors.
2. The data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure quality and consistency.
3. Feature engineering techniques are applied to create new informative features.

### 2. Feature Selection:

Techniques like Multicollinearity analysis and Feature importance scores are used to identify the most relevant features for predicting our target.

### 3. Machine Learning Model Training:

Machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Boosting, Stacking and Neural networks are trained on the prepared data.
The models aims to advance the field of cybersecurity by providing valuable insights into cyber threats and attack behaviors.

### 4. Model Evaluation:

The models' performance are evaluated on a held-out test set using metrics like classification report and confusion matrix.
The evaluation helps assess the models' accuracy and identify potential areas for improvement.

### 5. Results

The project will document the chosen features, the machine learning models' performance, and key insights gained from the analysis.
Visualizations like charts and graphs are included to illustrate the findings.
